                    Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love. 
                    And he raised his head and looked upon
                    the people, and there fell a stillness upon
                    them. And with a great voice he said:
                    When love beckons to you, follow him,
                    Though his ways are hard and steep.
                    And when his wings enfold you yield to
                    him,
                    Though the sword hidden among his
                    pinions may wound you.
                    And when he speaks to you believe in
                    him,
                    Though his voice may shatter your dreams
                    as the north wind lays waste the garden.
                    For even as love crowns you so shall he
                    crucify you. Even as he is for your growth
                    so is he for your pruning.
                    Even as he ascends to your height and
                    caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
                    in the sun,
                    So shall he descend to your roots and
                    shake them in their clinging to the earth.

                    <h4>On Teaching</h4>
                    <p>
                    Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching
                    And he said:
                    No man can reveal to you aught but that
                    which already lies half asleep in the daw-
                    ing of your knowledge.
                    The teacher who walks in the shadow of
                    the temple, among his followers, gives no
                    of his wisdom but rather of his faith and
                    his lovingness.
                    If he is indeed wise he does not bid you
                    enter the house of his wisdom, but rather
                    leads you to the threshold of your own mid
                    The astronomer may speak to you of his
                    understanding of space, but he cannot give
                    you his understanding.
                    The musician may sing to you of the
                    rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot
                    give you the ear which arrests the rhythm
                    nor the voice that echoes it.
                    And he who is versed in the science of
                    numbers can tell of the regions of weight
                    and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.
                    For the vision of one man lends not its
                    wings to another man.
                    And even as each one of you stands alone
                    in God's knowledge, so must each one of
                    you be alone in his knowledge of God and
                    in his understanding of the earth.
