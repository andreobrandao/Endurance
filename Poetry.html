                    <h4>On Love</h4>
                    Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love. 
                    And he raised his head and looked upon
                    the people, and there fell a stillness upon
                    them. And with a great voice he said:
                    When love beckons to you, follow him,
                    Though his ways are hard and steep.
                    And when his wings enfold you yield to
                    him,
                    Though the sword hidden among his
                    pinions may wound you.
                    And when he speaks to you believe in
                    him,
                    Though his voice may shatter your dreams
                    as the north wind lays waste the garden.
                    For even as love crowns you so shall he
                    crucify you. Even as he is for your growth
                    so is he for your pruning.
                    Even as he ascends to your height and
                    caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
                    in the sun,
                    So shall he descend to your roots and
                    shake them in their clinging to the earth.

                    <p align="center">
                    Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching <br>
                    And he said:<br>
                    No man can reveal to you aught but that<br>
                    which already lies half asleep in the dawn-<br>
                    ing of your knowledge.<br>
                    The teacher who walks in the shadow of<br>
                    the temple, among his followers, gives not<br>
                    of his wisdom but rather of his faith and<br>
                    his lovingness.<br>
                    If he is indeed wise he does not bid you<br>
                    enter the house of his wisdom, but rather<br>
                    leads you to the threshold of your own mind<br>
                    The astronomer may speak to you of his<br>
                    understanding of space, but he cannot give<br>
                    you his understanding.<br>
                    The musician may sing to you of the<br>
                    rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot<br>
                    give you the ear which arrests the rhythm<br>
                    nor the voice that echoes it.<br>
                    And he who is versed in the science of<br>
                    numbers can tell of the regions of weight<br>
                    and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.<br>
                    For the vision of one man lends not its<br>
                    wings to another man.<br>
                    And even as each one of you stands alone<br>
                    in God's knowledge, so must each one of<br>
                    you be alone in his knowledge of God and<br>
                    in his understanding of the earth.<br>
