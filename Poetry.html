                <h4>On Love</h4>
                Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love. <br>
                And he raised his head and looked upon<br>
                the people, and there fell a stillness upon<br>
                them. And with a great voice he said:<br>
                When love beckons to you, follow him,<br>
                Though his ways are hard and steep.<br>
                And when his wings enfold you yield to
                him,<br>
                Though the sword hidden among his
                pinions may wound you.<br>
                And when he speaks to you believe in
                him,<br>
                Though his voice may shatter your dreams<br>
                as the north wind lays waste the garden.<br>
                For even as love crowns you so shall he<br>
                crucify you. Even as he is for your growth<br>
                so is he for your pruning.<br>
                Even as he ascends to your height and<br>
                caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
                in the sun,<br>
                So shall he descend to your roots and<br>
                shake them in their clinging to the earth.<br> </center>

                <h4>On Teaching</h4>
                <p align="center">
                Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching <br>
                And he said:<br>
                No man can reveal to you aught but that<br>
                which already lies half asleep in the dawn-<br>
                ing of your knowledge.<br>
                The teacher who walks in the shadow of<br>
                the temple, among his followers, gives not<br>
                of his wisdom but rather of his faith and<br>
                his lovingness.<br>
                If he is indeed wise he does not bid you<br>
                enter the house of his wisdom, but rather<br>
                leads you to the threshold of your own mind<br>
                The astronomer may speak to you of his<br>
                understanding of space, but he cannot give<br>
                you his understanding.<br>
                The musician may sing to you of the<br>
                rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot<br>
                give you the ear which arrests the rhythm<br>
                nor the voice that echoes it.<br>
                And he who is versed in the science of<br>
                numbers can tell of the regions of weight<br>
                and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.<br>
                For the vision of one man lends not its<br>
                wings to another man.<br>
                And even as each one of you stands alone<br>
                in God's knowledge, so must each one of<br>
                you be alone in his knowledge of God and<br>
                in his understanding of the earth.<br>
