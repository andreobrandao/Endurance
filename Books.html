    <img style="position: relative; left: 8em; bottom: -6em; " width="200" align="left" src="images/the-prophet-book.jpeg" alt="the prophet-book">

            This book follows the history of a man who passed some long time in a city called orphalesea
            as a common man along with the other citizens, but with the arrival of a ship from his natal
            city he realize his time is done at that place, and he decides to walk from the upper hill
            to the harbour where he would take the ship, but while he walks with his things in hand, people
            from orphalesea realizes that much knowledge is what they could have taken from him, and one last 
            time they surround him as he walks asking him to speak about important things in life, about Love,
            about work, about marriage, about God, about our kids, about beauty and much more. The prophet
            brings wise words, and with his thoughts a lot for us to think and find a deeper meaning to our lifes
            It's a short book, but if you let yourself remain in his words you can find that the whole book holds
            more than it may appear at a first sight, it's for sure one of my favorite books of all time and
            i hope you can feel the beauty from this amazing work written by khalil Gibran.
