                    This book follows the history of a man who passed some long time in a city called orphalesea
                    as a common man along with the other citizens, but with the arrival of a ship from his natal
                    city he realize his time is done at that place, and he decides to walk from the upper hill
                    to the harbour where he would take the ship, but while he walks with his things in hand, people
                    from orphalesea realizes that much knowledge is what they could have taken from him, and one last 
                    time they surround him as he walks asking him to speak about important things in life, about Love,
                    about work, about marriage, about God, about our kids, about beauty and much more. The prophet
                    brings wise words, and with his thoughts a lot for us to think and find a deeper meaning to our lifes
                    It's a short book, but if you let yourself remain in his words you can find that the whole book holds
                    more than it may appear at a first sight, it's for sure one of my favorite books of all time and
                    i hope you can feel the beauty from this amazing work written by khalil Gibran.
